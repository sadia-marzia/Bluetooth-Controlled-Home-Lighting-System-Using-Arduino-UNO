# Bluetooth-Controlled-Home-Lighting-System-Using-Arduino-UNO
This project implements a Bluetooth-controlled home lighting system using an Arduino Uno, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and LDR sensor. It allows remote control of lights via a smartphone and ensures energy efficiency by activating the balcony light only in low-light conditions.
